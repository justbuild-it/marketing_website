**Original Content:**

## 3. Stats Section Transformation

### 3.1 Original Content (Inappropriate for New Company)
1. **130+ Integrations** - Implies extensive partnerships
2. **10x Faster Content Creation** - Vague speed claim
3. **100% AI-Powered Automation** - Generic statement
4. **24/7 Marketing Intelligence** - Standard availability claim

**Problem Identified:**
User feedback: "The ones shown are okay, but not very helpful" for a company "just starting out"

### 3.2 Proposed Options

**Option 1: Product Capability Focus**
1. **6 Agents** - AI Marketing Agents
2. **10x Faster** - Content Creation Speed
3. **Zero Setup** - Minutes to First Content
4. **100% Context** - AI Knows Your Business

**Option 2: Time & Efficiency Value**
1. **5 Minutes** - Setup to First Strategy
2. **10x Faster** - Than Manual Marketing
3. **24/7** - AI Working for You
4. **100% Automated** - End-to-End Workflow

**Option 3: Outcome & Results Focused** ‚≠ê SELECTED
1. **Complete Strategy** - In Minutes, Not Months
2. **Research-Backed** - Content with Citations
3. **Multi-Channel** - SEO, Social & AI Platforms
4. **Always Learning** - AI Improves Over Time

### 3.3 Final Implementation (Option 3)

**Rationale for Selection:**
- **No false claims** - No user counts or integration numbers to defend
- **Value-focused** - Emphasizes what customers get, not company scale
- **Credible** - All claims about product capabilities, not market position
- **Differentiated** - Highlights unique AI features and multi-channel approach
- **Future-proof** - "Always Learning" shows continuous improvement

### 3.4 Visual Design Improvements

**Original Styling Issues:**
- No visible borders (only on hover)
- Font size too large (`text-4xl` / 36px) - unbalanced
- No background differentiation
- Cards not clearly defined

**Updated Styling:**
```
- Border: 2px colored borders (always visible)
- Background: Gradient from light colors (blue, purple, cyan, green)
- Font size: text-xl (20px) for titles, text-sm for descriptions
- Padding: p-6 for breathing room
- Shadow: shadow-sm for subtle elevation
- Border radius: rounded-xl for modern look
```

**Color Scheme:**
1. Complete Strategy - Blue gradient (`from-blue-50 to-purple-50`, `border-blue-200`)
2. Research-Backed - Purple gradient (`from-purple-50 to-blue-50`, `border-purple-200`)
3. Multi-Channel - Cyan gradient (`from-cyan-50 to-blue-50`, `border-cyan-200`)
4. Always Learning - Green gradient (`from-green-50 to-cyan-50`, `border-green-200`)

**Rationale:**
- Visible borders make cards clearly defined without hover
- Smaller font size creates better visual balance
- Color-coded categories give each card distinct identity
- Gradient backgrounds add depth without overwhelming
- Professional appearance appropriate for B2B SaaS

## 4. Workflow Section Bullet Point Alignment

### 4.1 Issue Identified
**Problem:**
- Bullet points had `mt-1` (margin-top) class
- Caused misalignment with first line of text
- Bullets appeared slightly below text baseline

**User Feedback:**
"The bullet points below the main and subtitle are not aligned to their text."

### 4.2 Solution Implemented

**Change Made:**
- Replaced `mt-1` with `flex-shrink-0` on all bullet spans
- Applied across all 6 workflow cards (24 total bullet points)

**Before:**
```html
<span class="text-purple-600 mt-1">‚Ä¢</span>
```

**After:**
```html
<span class="text-purple-600 flex-shrink-0">‚Ä¢</span>
```

**Rationale:**
- `flex-shrink-0` prevents bullet from shrinking in flex container
- Keeps bullet at baseline alignment with text
- Provides clean, professional appearance
- Consistent alignment across all cards
